This project utilized a CNN-LSTM bi-directional model with an attention mechanism to predict stock prices by analyzing historical data.

- This project utilized a CNN-LSTM bi-directional model with an attention mechanism to predict stock prices by analyzing historical data. The combination of convolutional layers and LSTM layers with attention allowed the model to identify patterns in the data and learn trends over time. Preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and feature scaling, ensured the data was prepared effectively for modeling. Metrics like moving averages and daily returns were used to extract meaningful insights from the data, aiding in the model's understanding of trends.
This work demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models for stock price prediction by uncovering patterns that traditional methods may not detect.
